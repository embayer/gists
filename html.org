** Non-breaking Space
A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space:
&nbsp; A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new
line. Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together
(not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words
might be disruptive.

Examples:
-§ 10
-10 km/h
-10 PM

Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers
from truncating spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your
text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your
text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity. You can also use them
for visible whitespace (e.g. with background-color).
